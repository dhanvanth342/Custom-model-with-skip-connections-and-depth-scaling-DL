# Group14_CS584(Machine learning)
This repository is about the project which is part of CS584 (Machine Learning). The objective of this project is to construct a custom model with lesser parameters and higher performance with skip connections and depth scaling principals. We have considered 2 SOTA models(ResNet50 and VGG19) and one custom model in this project. 

Dataset 1: Butterfly and moth species (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/butterfly-images40-species)  
Dataset 2: FER (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)  
ml14a: Model training on Butterfly dataset  
Ml14b: Model training on FER dataset
